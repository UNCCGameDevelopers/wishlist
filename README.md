# Game Developers @ UNC Charlotte

Hi. We are Game Developers at UNC Charlotte!

Whether you are a programmer, artist, musician, story writer, puzzle designer, or just a creative person, you have the skills to help make a video game. We help you meet other enthusiasts with whom you can team up and create epic games. Even if you are just a beginner, joining our organization is a fun way of obtaining the necessary developing skills. 

Throughout the semester, we have weekly meetings. During these times, we show tutorials on various development software, have brainstorming sessions in which we discuss game ideas, and work on a group project. 

We hold a semesterly 49er Game Jam which where teams try to make a game within 49 hours. UNCC is also a host of the annual Global Game Jam (GGJ). This game jam is a worldwide event when participating teams create a game in a 48-hour time frame. This event typically occurs during the last weekend of January.
